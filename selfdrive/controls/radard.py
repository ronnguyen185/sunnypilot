"""VinFast radar–vision fusion daemon (radard_new).

Takes ``liveTracks`` (raw radar points from ``radar_interface_new``) and
``modelV2`` (vision model) and produces ``radarState`` with up to two fused
leads for the longitudinal planner.

Design philosophy
-----------------
* **Radar-trusted**: radar data that passed RadarInterface filters is reliable.
  Fusion prefers radar+vision, but trusts radar-only when vision is weak.
* **Speed-dependent safety**: implausibly close leads are rejected based on ego
  speed (``min_lead_distance``).
* **Lead hysteresis**: prevents lead-switch jitter when two tracks score
  similarly by requiring a margin before swapping.
